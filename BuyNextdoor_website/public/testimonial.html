BMC has a culture of solid teamwork, the nine aspects are important, each aspect has a unique one way of communication</p>

                    I started doing my research on Facebook and I learned a lot about the company as well as it's operations everyday which make it such a successful company. I also had a brief picture about how I can make the BMC of my own startup or any startup in general.

                <p class="bmcreview">This internship introduced BMC to me. BMC is essentially an organized way to layout your assumptions about not only the key resources and key activities of your value chain, but also your value proposition, customer relationships, channels, customer segments, cost structures, and revenue streams. 
                    By laying out your business on the canvas, you can quickly see if there are any faults in your plan. 
                    So, basically BMC makes things easy and can be explained in a short way. </p>

                <p class="bmcreview">It was a good experience on exploring how a startup built. The Webinar gave me clear view of different important aspects of a startup. A BMC has a lot importance in setting a plan and to get clear view of the business model. It pays attention on every aspect right from the consumer need to the demand and supply chain. And the value it adds to a customer is also important.</p>

Also, it illustrates the business quickly and easily, by presenting the most important aspects that affect the success. However, other considerations of business success are implicit but not explicitly covered by the business model board such as the level and nature of competition and the determination of measurable goals.</p>

                <p class="bmcreview">While preparing the BMC , I got to know a lot of things that I wouldn’t notice otherwise. Everything seems simple when you look at the bigger picture, but I learned that a lot goes into making a business or a company stick. When it comes to key partners, value propositions, etc., there’s a lot of intricacies that doesn’t really capture attention unless you deeply inspect the business model canvas. All in all, I learned that forming a company isn’t simple, rather, every single detail requires speculation and planning.</p>
